Painter's Partition Problem
The Painter's Partition Problem is a classic problem in algorithmic design that involves dividing a task into smaller sub-tasks while minimizing the maximum workload assigned to any worker. It can be solved efficiently using binary search on the answer.

Problem Statement
You are given:
n boards with lengths given in an array arr[].k painters to paint these boards.Each painter takes the same amount of time to paint one unit of a board. A painter can paint only contiguous boards. The task is to assign boards to painters such that the maximum time taken by any painter to complete their job is minimized.

Key Constraints
A painter can only paint contiguous boards.
Every board must be painted, and no board can be split between painters.
Objective
Minimize the maximum time required by a painter.

Approach to Solve
Key Insight:

If the workload for each painter is minimized, the maximum time taken to paint all boards will also be minimized.
Define the Search Space:

Lower Bound (s): The length of the largest board (max(arr)), since no painter can paint less than the largest board in any valid solution.
Upper Bound (e): The sum of all board lengths (sum(arr)), which represents the case where a single painter paints all boards.
Binary Search on the Answer:

Use binary search to find the smallest possible maximum workload.
For a given mid-point mid in the search space:
Check if it's possible to divide the boards among the painters such that no painter gets a workload exceeding mid.
If possible, reduce the upper bound (e) to try for a smaller maximum workload.
If not possible, increase the lower bound (s) to allow more workload.
Helper Function:

Simulate the partitioning of boards:
Count the number of painters required for a given mid as the maximum workload.
Ensure the number of painters does not exceed k.
Result:

The smallest value of mid for which partitioning is possible will be the optimal solution.
Algorithm
Start with the range [max(arr), sum(arr)].
Use binary search to find the optimal maximum workload.
For each mid-point in the range:
Simulate the partitioning of boards using the helper function.
Adjust the range based on whether the partitioning is feasible.
Return the minimum valid mid.
